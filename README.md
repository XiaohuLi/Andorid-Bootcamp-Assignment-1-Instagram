Please review my assignment 1.

Here is what I accomplished:

1) User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
2) For each photo displayed, user can see the following details:
    Graphic, Caption, Username, relative timestamp, like count, user profile image
3) Advanced: Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageView
4) Advanced: Improve the user interface through styling and coloring

Meanwhile there are two issues with this app I don't know how to resolve yet
1) There is a gap between the image and the likes count
2) The user profile image does not seem be to scaled properly.

Here is the gif:
